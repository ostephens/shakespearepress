Shakespearepress
================

ShakespearePress is a Wordpress plugin that adds the full text of a Shakespeare play to a Wordpress installation. It was developed as part was created as part of #willhack, a online hackathon run by EDINA (http://willsworld.edina.ac.uk/) as part of the JISC Discovery program (http://discovery.ac.uk/) in December 2012.

Each paragraph of text in the play is turned into a Wordpress Post, tagged with Act number, Scene number, and the name of the character speaking (where relevant). It will eventually add more tools which show key terms/characters from the text and link to further resources.

Currently the plugin adds the first Act of "Much Ado About Nothing" only.
